**Please note: this project is hosted on the free tier of Render, and as such it may take a minute to load if it hasn't been accessed in a while. Free Render lets applications go dormant when they are not in use.**

## DayBreaker is a simple Daily Task organizer
It's main objective is to provide a minimally worded task list upon loading, with checkboxes for completing tasks. From the landing page, the user can click on each item in the task list for further details or create a new task to add to the list.
Clicking on a task brings the user to that task's details, and the option to edit or delete the task.
Tasks are organized alphabetically by Category.

Updates I am willing to entertain to this app:
ability to have recurring tasks
randomized words of encouragement included on the Show route
links to supporting webpages (ie, LinkedIn button on a Networking task)


### Technologies used to create this project include:
MongoDB and Mongoose
Express
React
Node.js
Javascript
and some junior-dev-level grit and resilience

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
